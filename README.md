A web-based handwritten digit recognition application built with Flask and a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw a digit on a web canvas, and the model predicts the digit in real time.

Features
✔️ Interactive drawing canvas (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
✔️ Flask backend to process grayscale pixel data
✔️ Trained TensorFlow/Keras model for digit classification
✔️ Uses Fetch API to send user input to the server
✔️ Converts user-drawn images to a 28×28 grayscale format for prediction

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy

Data Format: JSON (for communication between frontend and backend)
